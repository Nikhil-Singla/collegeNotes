Definition of NFA => 
Defined using 5 tuples: (Q, Σ, q₀, F, 𝝳)
Q = Set of all states       -> {A, B}
Σ = Input                   -> {0, 1}
q₀ = Start/Initial State    -> A
F = Final states            -> B
𝝳 = Maps Q x Σ -> 2ᵠ (where that symbol is Q. Just no superscript version in normal language)
2 ^ Q is just the power set of Q, ie all the subsets of Q. The number of elements in this set is also equal to 2 ^ number of elements in Q.
If we have above Q. Here the 2ᵠ indicates how A can go to A, B, AB, or φ as all possible situations in the worst case scenario

.    0      1
A   A,B     A
B    φ      φ

Comparison to DFA
Similarities => 
We have a start state and end state

Differences =>
Doesn't need to be complete to have the NFA finished.
May have multiple next states.
