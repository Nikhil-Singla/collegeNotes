Introduction to Theory of Computation:
-> Most fundamental courses of Comp Sci: Subject about what things you can compute mechanically and with how fast/how much space taken.

Things you can compute:
Strings which follow certain rules (eg. Binary strings that end in 0)
Machine that accepts all valid Java code (eg. Compilers)
Compilers arose from theory of computation

Things you cannot compute:
Program that accepts all valid java codes and never goes into infinite loop. (Cannot check for infinite loop)

Subject: Design systems that take input and return yes or no.
Layers: 
1. FSM : Finite state machine - Simplest model and limited memory/calculations)
2. CFL : Context free language - More powerful, slightly higher level computations) 
    Language actually refers to a set of strings.
3. Turing Machine 
4. Undecidable : Problems that cannot be solved

Finite state machine - 
Symbol - a, b, c, 1, 2, 3
Alphabet - Collection of symbols (Denoted by Σ) {a, b}, {d, e, f, g}, {0, 1, 2 . . .}
String - Sequence of symbols. eg: a, b, aa, bb, ab, 01, 1011
Language - Set of strings 

Example: if Σ = {0, 1}
Language (L1: Finite Set) = Set of strings of length 2 = {00, 01, 10, 11}
Language (L2: Finite Set) = Set of strings of length 3 = {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}
Language (L3: Infinite Set) = Set of strings that begin with 0 = {0, 01, 001, 010, 000, 000010 . . .}

Powers of Σ:
¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹⁰
Σ = {0, 1}
Σ⁰ = Set of all strings of length 0 = {ε}
Σ¹ = Set of all strings of length 1 = {0, 1}
Σ² = Set of all strings of length 2 = {00, 01, 10, 11}
Σ³ = . . .
Σⁿ = Set of all strings of length n.

Cardinality: Number of elements in the set. 
Σ⁰ = 1
Σ¹ = 2
Σ² = 4 . . .Σⁿ = 2ⁿ

Σ* = Σ⁰ U Σ¹ U Σ² U Σ³ . . . U Σⁿ = Set of all possible strings of all lengths using the alphabets Σ
