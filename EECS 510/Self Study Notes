Introduction to Theory of Computation:
-> Most fundamental courses of Comp Sci: Subject about what things you can compute mechanically and with how fast/how much space taken.

Things you can compute:
Strings which follow certain rules (eg. Binary strings that end in 0)
Machine that accepts all valid Java code (eg. Compilers)
Compilers arose from theory of computation

Things you cannot compute:
Program that accepts all valid java codes and never goes into infinite loop. (Cannot check for infinite loop)

Subject: Design systems that take input and return yes or no.
Layers: 
1. FSM : Finite state machine - Simplest model and limited memory/calculations)
2. CFL : Context free language - More powerful, slightly higher level computations) 
    Language actually refers to a set of strings.
3. Turing Machine 
4. Undecidable : Problems that cannot be solved
