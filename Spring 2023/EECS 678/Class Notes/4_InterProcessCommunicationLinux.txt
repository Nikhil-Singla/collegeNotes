Pipes
Most commonly/basic form of IPC of Unix System
- Unidirectional Communication
- Processes must be stored in the same OS
- Pipes exist only until the processes exist
- Data can only be collected in FIFO order
Ex. $ ls | more => Output of one process (ls) goes into the other process (more)

ls - list
more - print out one thing at a time
fork => Create child process with identical state of the parent.
