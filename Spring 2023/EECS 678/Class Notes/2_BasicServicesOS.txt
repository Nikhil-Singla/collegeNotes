View of OS:
- Start from Hardware.
But we will learn about the Kernel Mode components
Or the services offered under Operating System (Program Execution, I/O operations, File systems, Communications etc.)
User mode is the third level -> GUI, Batch commands, command line (All part of the user interface UI) part of the system calls.

OSS: (Operating System Service)
User interface : Command Line Interface (CLI) vs Graphical User Interface (GUI)

CLI:
- Command Line intrepreter (shell): Sllows to type commands executed by OS. [We will write as part of the project]
- User level software that take comand from user and execute after interpreting to the OS.
- Many flavors: bash, csh, ksh etc. Not a part of the kernel.
- Some are also external programs: find, grep; while, Some are built in: alias, echo, read

Best use is : Precision as mouse cannot be as precise as keyboard can describe.
Other than that, CLI is preferred because also easy to implement, and easier to 
automate and faster as it uses less resources. It can also be accessed remotely.
But the biggest drawback is that it is difficult to learn.

GUI:
- Uses mouse, keyboard and monitor.
- Invented at Xerox PARC, adopted to Mac(intosh) and Windows etc. UI 

They are easier to use, but use a lot more hardware resources.

OSS Aspects - 
1) File system service: Read/write/create/delete/search file and directories along with their information and manage permissions
2) Communications: Share info between computers (on a network) or processes (same computer/inter-computer processes)
3) Resource allocation: CPU cycles, main memory space, file space, I/O devices
4) Accounting: Track users and usage
5) Security: Login, admin privilege vs normal user vs guests
6) Protection: Prevent memory coruption (b/w user, programs and kernel) while detecting and reporting any errors.

System Calls:
- Programming interface to use the services of the OS/Provide interface.
Typically written in high-level language (C)
Most programmers don't use sytem calls but instead use API's, but system programmers do.

Most popular system call API's are:
- win32 (windows)
- POSIX API (POSIX based systems, also Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X)
