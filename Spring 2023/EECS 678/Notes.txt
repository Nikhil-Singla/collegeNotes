OS is everywhere: Computer, Smartphone, Cars, etc.
What is OS:
1) User - An easy to use virtual machine by hiding complex details (CPU, Memory, Where to store the data) and 
    providing API's and services (read, write, filesystems).
2) System - A resource manager (for the CPU, memory, storage etc), to make sure everyone gets fair share of
    resources. Monitor/prevent errors and improper use.

OS is a program that always runs (typically in kernel mode)
Why is it needed?
- Programmability: Don't need to know hardware details to do stuff.

Memory Isolation:
- Data stored can only be accessed by authorized.
- Foundation of security.
- Enforced by hardware
