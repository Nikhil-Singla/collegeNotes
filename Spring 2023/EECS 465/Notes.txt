Cyber Defense:
Course webpage is available on Canvas
Goal: Teach students the critical knowledge to administer and defend computer networks and systems.
Usage to learn: Computer security tools
Secure services, applications and operating 
- Explanation of syllabus

Don't be attackers:
Unauthorized access is illigal, even if its unintentional
Anything goes on these hosts. Get the login from Lab room.
Clone stuff using CloneZilla and store on Network using NAS, then use NFS (secure protocol) to restore stuff 
on the local area network.
Available clean images: Kali, Ubuntu, Windows ...

Kali Linux: Aimed at digital forensics and penetration testing.
Based on Debian GNU. Backtrack is based on Ubuntu and provides easy access to 
comprehensive and large collection of tools.

Network Terminology
1) NIC: Network Interface Controller (aka Network Card/Network Interface)
    Structure for wireless follows same principle.
2) MAC: Media Access Control Address: Unique identifier assigned to network interface for communication on physical 
    network segment. EG: 00:A0:C9:00:11:22  First three are the manufacturer (eg. Intel) and the last three are
    the unique card ID. MAC address always stays the same.
3) Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) : Numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network
    and uses IP for communication. Two functions are host and network identifier, Location addressing.

Versions of IP Address. 
IPv4 (IP version 4: 32 bits for address)
IPv6 (IP version of 128 bits for address)
because 32 bits is not enough for all the possible addresses.
They are usually binary numbers but stored in formats that are human readable.
172 . 16 . 254 . 1
    xxx . 00010000 . 11111110 . 00000001
1 byte = 8 bits and each address is 32 bits or (4 * 8) -> 4 bytes
IPv6 (in hexadecimal) 34 with 37 zeroes. So a lot more address.

IP vs MAC (oversimplified)
IP => Software Implementation support
MAC => Hardware Implementation of the network stack
MAC remains fixed and follows device, but IP address changes as network device moves between networks.

4) Ports: Can refer to the physical or virtual connection points. Physical ports allow cables (routers, modems, etc)
    Virtual ports are software applications to share hardware resources (16 bit numbers 0 - 65535)
    (Applications using different ports to direct network packets to proper connection requirements. Eg, Discord 
    network is different port from Chrome port which differs from Genshin port)

Ports are divided into 3 ranges
Well Known (0 - 1023); Registered (1024 - 49151); Dynamic/Private ports (49152 - 65535)
Eg: 
20 & 21: (FTP)
22: Secure Shell (SSH)
23: Telnet
25: Simple Mail TP 
80: HyperText TP - WWW
443: HTTP Secure - HTTPS

IPv4 Network Ranges:
IP address has 2 parts
    - Network portion
    - Host number portion

Network Connection Details: ifconfig [Interface Config for the Internet]
Loopback interface is the internal interface to the own computer.
Virtual network interface only at the local level [Home interface]
