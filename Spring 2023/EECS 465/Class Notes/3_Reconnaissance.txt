Reconnaissance: Information gathering
2 step process: 
Open source intelligence gathering, (publicly available information)
    In class activity tool : TheHarvester (Gathering a lot of the domains etc)
    Is it okay to collect?
    Technically yes, but depends on how many times you are going to collect
Result: Quite a few domain/host names that maps to IP addresses.
Scan hosts connected to a network to determine:
    - Live hosts
    - Network topology, etc
Use NMAP next, a port scanner that looks for open ports, ping sweeper and fingerprinting tool for the OS.
A port open means there's an application/process running which might be a potential entrypoint.

Nmap Scans : 
    Ping Sweeps - nmap -sP <target_ip>
    TCP connect - nmap [-sT] <target_ip>
        TCP Three-way Handshake - SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK are the packets exchanged to establish a confirmed line 
    UDP - Send a UDP packet nmap -sU <target_ip> [Good for streaming/sending log files]

TCP:
    -> If threeway-Handshake is NOT completed: Instead of final ACK, send RST or NOTHING
    -> Slightly stealthy

NMAP exploits this 
- using TCP FIN mode by sending TCP FIN to a target port, violation of TCP specification.
    If no response, port may be open, more stealthy, will have diff effect on Microsoft Systems not following RFC
- using Xmas Tree TCP segment with FIN, URG and PSH code bit set. RST -> Port closed, port open otherwise
- using TCP ACK mode: RST is returned -> packet made through filter.
- etc <slides>

No need to go through all ports, just on ranges of well known ports.
    thus, NMAP scan also has specific port ranges, setting source ports to prevent packet blocks, 
    and using decoys (packets and source address decoy)

UDP :
    No three-way, no sequence

<LAB NMAP activity>
-> -T4  : Timing template -> Adjust overall Nmap speed from very slow (T0, to extremely aggressive -T5)
->  v   : increase verbosity
-> -A   : enable OS detection

For legallity: You need to own both host and the infrastructure. Eg. Routers and switches from source of scan to host
AFter network scan: Vulnerability Scanning is next.
Attackers can start searching automatically using automated tools that scans hosts for known vulnerabilities.
Used with other reconnaissance to plan attacks using credentialted vulnerability scanner.

Vulnerability scanner is backed up by vulnerability database.
Banner is one way to fingerprint, others are also possible using probing packets.

VAS : Vulnerability Assessment Tool
Nessus : proprietary, Free for Home use, Run on Windows, Linux, etc.
OpenVAS: Open-source fork when Nessus became proprietary, less checks/functionality.
Two major components of Nessus:
    Server : Vulnerability Database + Scanning engine
    Client : Create policy, runs cans and view results

Nessus Plugins:
- Plugin => program that checks for given known flaw as every audit is coded as plugin.
- Customizable using NASL (Nessus Attack Scripting Language)
- NASL is used in OpenVAS (100000+ network vul. tests) and Nessus (181000+ plugins) 

Major plugin families: Backdoors, Brute force attacks, CISCO, Databases, Debian Local Security Checks, Default Unix Accounts,
    Denial of Service, Fedora Local Security Checks, Firewalls, Web Servers, Windows.

DO NOT USE NESSUS ON THE WEB as they are very very aggressive.
