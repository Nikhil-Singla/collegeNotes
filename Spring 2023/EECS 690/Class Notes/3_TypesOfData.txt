Data pre-processing: Hands-on
    Data cleaning : Wrangling, Handle missing data and Smooth noisy data.
    Data change: Integration, transformation, reduction and discretization.

Data Wrangling: No specific method, just depends on nature of the data to make it more analysis friendly.
>              Makes the data more convenient and desirable.
Process of manually converting/mapping data from "raw" to another format.

Smooth noisy data: When data is corrupted, no single technique to take care of missing data. Some steps include,
>              remove outliers, resolve inconsistencies, etc.

Data integration: Assuming we have another dataset to integrate, smooth over the values and adapt them to our original data.

Data transformation: Involves smoothing, removing noise, summarization, generalization and normalization.

Data reduction: Producing reduced representation of tthe dataset to obtain similar analytical results.

Outliers: Look for data points that make no sense. More than 1.0 percentage,
