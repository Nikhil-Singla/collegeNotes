Introduction to R

R packages: Install R studio if needed, otherwise Anaconda is also good.
You can use Jupyter Notebook / R Studio

Hands-On Purposes:
Types of Data Analysis:
- Descriptive
- Exploratory
- Predictive
- Inferential       : Looks for patterns, trends, or relationships in a single data set and also asks for quantification of how applicable these findings are to the wider population
- Causal            : Relationship between factors and if changing one factor will lead to a change in another factor
- Mechanistic       : question that asks about the underlying mechanism of the observed patterns, trends,

Analysis Tool
-> Summarization    : Computing and reporting aggregated values pertaining to a data set
-> Visualization    : Plotting data graphically
-> Regression       : Predicting a quantitative value for a new observation
-> Clustering       : Finding previously unknown/unlabeled subgroups in a data set
-> Estimation       : Taking measurements for a small number of items from a large group and making a good guess for 
-                       the average or proportion for the large group

R as a programming environment:
- Open source & Cross Platform
- Data analyst and storage
- Designed to perform on vectors, matrices and uses well devloped but simple programming language
- Allows for rapid development, and tools are distributed as packages which any user can download
- Intuitive graphics system with easy to create data analysis reports.

R is strong in data analysus and research.
Python is strong in ML and database app development
