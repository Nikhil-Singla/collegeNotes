What is data science?
Field of study and practice involving collection, storage and processing of data to derive 
important insight into a problem.

Who creates: Humans (survey, exam, papers), Machines (IoT, Weather data), Formats (Text, audio, VR, AR)
Why is it imp: Lot of data and analysis requires training

Three V's [See diagram in slides]
Velocity: Speed data is accumulated
Volume: Size and scope of data
Variety: Array of data types

Ex uses of DS:
- Finance (Build prediction models) - Risk/fraud detection
- Public health data (Metabolomic studies, DNA sequencing) - Personal wearable health trackers
    Help in: Insight to patient centered medical quandaries (uncertainities)
- Elementary education
- Politics
- Data driven solutions are more effective
    How: Computerized software that constantly collects and measures data.
    Teachers receive automated readout about reading time, vocabulary, knowledge, reading comprehension
    Insight to students performance and learning approach.

Relation to DS.
Statistics: Sub-field of another
Comp Sci: CS and DS are mutually supportive (Databases, data centers, structured and unstructured data)
Computer Engineering: CPU, GPU, 3d printing
Business analytics: Skills, tech and iterative exploration. Gain insight and be strategic. Make sense of performance
