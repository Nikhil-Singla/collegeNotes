VHDL Slides [Book]
Hardware Description Languages (HDL's) [Programm another device]
Programming Languages (PL's) [Program a microprocessor]
We program a device from inside that operates in a certain way to deliver certain functionality.
PL's, most of these languages are called sequential languages. ie, execution follows a certain order.
In Multi-core CPU, the instructions still happen in sequence.

HDL's/ Digital Logic Circuit are concurrent by default. Limited by how fast circuity can switch.

Modern HDL's.
1) Encapsulate concepts: Entities, Objects, Concurrency, Delay and Timing.
2) Core is that everything is parallel/concurrent
3) Functional languages
4) Support constructs so you need to first describe behaviour/structure of your construct.

Two HDL's used:
VHDL and Verilog. Syntax different, abilities similar. Verilog before VHDL. VHDL adopted by IEEE as a standard as it was more
powerful by design. Verilog similar to C/C++: Industries [West], VHDL similar to Ada/Pascal: Military [East]
VHDL is powerful but has more features while Verilog uses pre-defined types mostly until update.

You cannot have infinite bits, so you need type to impose limitations onto the precision of Computer Hardware. To maintain 
accuracy we need to have types as a limitations imposed on us by the underlying hardware.

n1 bits * n2 bits = (n1 + n2) bits needed for answer
Dynamic range: Range/ Values that a given variable can take.
Gaps between intervals for ints are same. Floats increase exponentially.
Float can thus get a lot more storage/bits.

Strongly Typed: Types have to match.
Weakly Typed: Types need to match that accurately.
C IS WEAKLY TYPED AS IT STILL RUNS DESPITE MIGHT HAVING PROBLEMS.

VHSIC (Very High Speed Intergrated Circuit) HDL
Revised continously. transferred to IEEE by Dept of Defense; Made it VHDL. 

Entity Declaration: I/O ports ("outline" of the circuit) [Think of function argument definition]
Architecture body:
    Collection of parts
    Signal declarations
    Concurrent Statement: Thought of as circuit part/contains timing information.

Type is just the number of bits we use.
Multiline wire = Slash['/'] followed by a number of bits. (AKA bus)
Comments done using --
VHDL IS CONCURRENT. SO ORDER DOESN'T MATTER as each statement describes a physical object.
Execution of VHDL: Simulation [Design realised in virtual environment, BY A SINGLE CPU]
Synthesis is very different [CHECK SLIDES]

Testbenches:
Debug code by designing testbenches that generate [Design under test/ Unit under test (DUT, UUT)] stimuli to test our code.
Know your test vectors, what you should expect, and compare it to debug.
Waveform diagram: The green diagram in Vivado that is a diagram over time.
Tester code + DUT forms one unit.

How to use Vivado tutorial. [Also slides]
Dont copy design sources from original folder so that you don't accidentally delete your design incase source crashes.
Run simulation for 1000ns by default in simulation settings by right clicking "Run Simulation"

Add if statements to the class code to reach the end of testcases.
Waveform is just a visual reference.
