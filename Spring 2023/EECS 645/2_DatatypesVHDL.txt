Definition of Datatype:
    Set of values that an object can assume [Dynamic range] AND
    Set of operations that can be performed on that object

VHDL is strongly typed.
Mismatch causes an error and needs typecasting/typeconversion.

Integer:
    Minimal range -(2^31 - 1) to +(2^31 - 1)
    Subtypes include natural, positive.
Boolean:
    False, True. 
Bit:
    '1', or '0', not too powerful. 1 bit vector translates into a group of wire called a bus

STD_logic_package adds more power to bit with the single wire modelling. It has more values (9 types) and the package needs 
    to be invoked to use. [.all uses everything in the package invocation]
The package helps in simulating scenario of ports and see if the code can work in real life applications.
    0 means ground and 1 means power supply in a digital logic circuit. 
If 1 is connected to 0, it results in a short circuit/explosion and is represented by 'X' in the package, etc.

How to infer arithmetic operators: numeric_std package (Defines types flexible in bits)
In standard VHDL, sum <= a + b;
** Integer is 32 bits (precision)
What's wrong with integer? : Overflow, or Underuse of Memory Space.
There's no type to use less number of bits either.

In numeric_std:
There are unsigned and signed data types. An array is interpreted as an unsigned or signed binary number.
15 down to 0 implies 16 bits. Package also defines addition "+" for these datatypes.
Package needs to be invoked too though.

Conversion can be done using typecasting.
data type of a          to data type
std_logic_vector        signed              => signed(a)
.                       unsigned            => unsigned(a)
unsigned, signed        std_logic_vector    => std_logic_vector(a)

unsigned, signed        integer             => to_integer(a)
natural                 unsigned            => to_unsigned(a, size)
integer                 signed              => to_signed(a, size)

Non-IEEE packages
Packages by Synopsys. Tool vendors frequently store them in ieee library.

std_logic_unsigned / std_logic_signed [Overloads; convenient, but ruins the motivation of strongly typed language], numeric_std is preferred.

Summary of VHDL using synthesizable concurrent VHDL statements: [While everything is simulatable, summary statements are also synthesizable]
1) Direct Assignment -> Dataflow Style
    Left hand side, assign to it something from right hand side using the '<=' symbol.
    Right hand side could also be regular boolean expressions.
    "mux" is Multiplexer: It is a selecter that selects 1 out of 4 depending on the select signal. 2^select size signal
Everything in VHD translates to physical object
