Symetric and Asymetric Encryptions
-> Symetric
    Block cipher
    Stream cipher
Usage depends on processing of input.
Vigenere is not a block cipher because Vigenere processes the block as a whole, not one by one.
DES: Data Encryption Standard, minor variation of the Feistel structure.

AES: Advanced Encryption Standard
BLOCK SIZE IS FIXED

DES Cipher: 
Block cipher of 64 bit-block sides
Only 56-bit keys as every 8th bit is for parity.
16 rounds => Conducts for 16 times/block
