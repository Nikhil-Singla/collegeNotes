Dijkstra's Algorithm: Greedy Method
Dijkstra's Shortest Path Medthod

Weighted directed/undirected graphs.

Pseudocode:
Let start distance from start vertex = 0
Start distance from all other vertices = infinity
WHILE vertices remain unvisited:
    Visit unvisited vertext with smallest known distance from start vertex (current vertex)
    FOR each unvisited neighbour of the current vertex
        Calculate distance from start vertex
        IF distance from start vertex is less than the known distance
            Update the shortest distance to this vertex
        end if
    NEXT unvisited neighbour vertex
    Add the current vertex to the list of visited vertex
END WHILE

Hash function design:
Essential Requirements - 
1) The hash function must distribute the hash value evenly on the hash table
2) The hash function must be computable in constant time (otherwise we would not have the expected time complexity)

AVL Tree is due to Adelson, Velskii, and Landis.
the AVL property: for each node, the height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree cannot differ by more than 1
• A binary search tree that satisfies the AVL property is called an AVL tree
• An AVL tree guarantees O(log n) search/insert/remove times
