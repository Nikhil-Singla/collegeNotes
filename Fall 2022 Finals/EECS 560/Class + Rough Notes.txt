Datastructures and Algorithms:

Module 0: Fundamentals
ADT is a mathematical abstraction of a data structure. It refers to both the data and the methods.
- For example: Vector, Queue, Stack, Hash Table, etc.
- Its object primarily is an array
- Methods usually have at least one pointer to retrieve a value of some kind, iterator to a value, and usually a size() to get the size of the ADT
ADT Use: Implementation details and analyze efficiency.

Simple ADTs include: list, queue, stack, and hash table
– Tree-based ADTs: search trees, heaps, disjoint sets
– Graph ADTs
– Sorting algorithms
