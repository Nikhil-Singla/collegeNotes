Q4. Each employee of a certain company is in either Department X or Department Y, and there are more than twice 
as many employees in Department X as in Department Y. The average (arithmetic mean) salary is $25,000 for the employees 
in Department X and $35,000 for the employees in Department Y. Which of the following amounts could be the average salary 
for all of the employees of the company? Indicate all such amounts.
A $26,000 B $28,000 C $29,000 D $30,000 E $31,000 F $32,000 G $34,000
ANS: A, B

EXPLANATION: One strategy for answering this kind of question is to find the least and/or greatest possible value. 
Clearly the average salary is between $25,000 and $35,000, and all of the answer choices are in this interval. 
Since you are told that there are more employ- ees with the lower average salary, the average salary of all employees 
must be less than the average of $25,000 and $35,000, which is $30,000. If there were exactly twice as many employees 
in Department X as in Department Y, then the average salary for all employees would be, to the nearest dollar, the 
following weighted mean, ((2)(25,000) + (1)(35,000))/(2+1) ≈ 28,333 dollars where the weight for $25,000 is 2 and 
the weight for $35,000 is 1. Since there are more than twice as many employees in Department X as in Department Y, 
the actual average salary must be even closer to $25,000 because the weight for $25,000 is greater than 2. 
This means that $28,333 is the greatest possible average. Among the choices given, the possible values of the average 
are therefore $26,000 and $28,000. Thus the correct answer consists of Choices A ($26,000) and B ($28,000).

Intuitively, you might expect that any amount between $25,000 and $28,333 is a possible value of the average salary. 
To see that $26,000 is possible, in the weighted mean above, use the respective weights 9 and 1 instead of 2 and 1. 
To see that $28,000 is possible, use the respective weights 7 and 3.
